Introduction
------------

This is a `Django CMS` plugin for news.

Installation
------------

First, you must install `Django CMS` and `photologue` which require `Django` 
and a few other libraries such as `PIL`. For full details, see the installation 
instructions for those packages.

Install ``cmsplugin-newsy`` to your environment with a tool such as `PIP`, 
`setuptools`, or `buildout`.

Add ``newsy`` to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list in your project's 
``settings.py`` and run the ``syncdb`` command on your ``manage.py``.
